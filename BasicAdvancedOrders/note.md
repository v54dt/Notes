# Trading Platform Architecture

## Overview

Our trading system employs a dual-middleware architecture where the trading middleware and smart order middleware operate as independent systems. This separation necessitates different routing paths for regular orders versus intelligent orders.

## Order Routing Strategy

The SDK handles intelligent routing to ensure orders reach the appropriate middleware:

- **Basic Orders**: Intraday orders (market/limit orders) → Standard trading middleware
- **Advanced Orders**: Intelligent order types → Smart order middleware
  - Intraday stop-loss and take-profit orders
  - Conditional trigger orders
  - Long-term persistent orders

## User Experience

This architectural complexity remains completely transparent to end users. The SDK provides a unified API interface, eliminating the need for different function signatures or manual routing decisions. Users interact with a single, consistent interface regardless of the underlying middleware complexity.

## Implementation Challenges

While this design provides flexibility and separation of concerns, it introduces several integration complexities:

- **Order State Aggregation**: The SDK must consolidate pending orders from both platforms to present a unified portfolio view
- **Execution Reporting**: Trade fills and execution reports from both systems require real-time aggregation and normalization
- **Future Extensibility**: Any planned SDK-level order management features will necessitate cross-platform data synchronization and state management
